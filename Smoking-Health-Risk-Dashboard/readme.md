# 🚬 Smoking Health Risk Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the physiological and demographic risks associated with different smoking statuses — **Never Smoked, Current Smoker, and Former Smoker**.

The dashboard explores correlations between:
- Smoking duration
- Cigarettes per day (CPD)
- Age groups
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Vital organ health (Heart, Liver, Kidney, Lungs)

The objective is to provide a visual, data-driven assessment of how smoking impacts long-term health outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Data Modeling
- Interactive Visual Design

---

## 📊 Key Metrics & KPIs

- Dynamic Total Patient Count (e.g., 336 patients in filtered view)
- Average Age Benchmark (~53–57 years)
- Average BMI (~30.0 — Overweight/Obese threshold)

The dashboard enables dynamic filtering to analyze risk distribution across age groups and smoking categories.

## 🚬 Smoking Status Insights

### 📌 Population Distribution
- Never Smoked: ~40%
- Current Smokers: ~31%
- Former Smokers: ~29%

### 👥 Gender Flow Analysis
A ribbon chart visualizes smoking behavior patterns across male and female demographics.

### 📈 Smoking Duration & Intake
A trend analysis tracks:
- Years of Smoking (YOS)
- Cigarettes Per Day (CPD)
- Age Group Segmentation (18–69+)

Peak consumption trends are observed in mid-to-late age brackets.

## 🩺 Clinical Risk Assessment

### 🫀 Organ Health Indicators
Interactive anatomical visuals dynamically display organ condition:
- Healthy
- Damaged

Organ damage correlates strongly with higher CPD values and extended smoking duration.

### 📉 Blood Pressure & Cholesterol Risk
A stacked bar analysis highlights:
- High BP prevalence in older age groups (59–68, 69+)
- Increased hypertension risk among Former and Current smokers

---

## 📊 Key Findings

1. Age Correlation  
   Older age groups show higher prevalence of former smokers and elevated blood pressure risk.

2. Organ Impact  
   Higher cigarette consumption directly correlates with increased damaged organ indicators.

3. Combined Risk Factor  
   Elevated BMI (~30.0 average) combined with smoking status significantly increases health risk exposure.
